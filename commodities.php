						Indian markets (Indian Commodity Market) have recently thrown open a new avenue for retail
						investors and traders to participate: commodity
						derivatives. For those who want to diversify their portfolios beyond shares, bonds and real
						estate, commodities is the best option.</p>

					<p>Till some months ago, this wouldn't have made sense. For retail investors could
						have done very little to actually invest in commodities such as gold and silver -- or
						oilseeds in the futures market. This was nearly impossible in commodities except for gold
						and silver as there was practically no retail avenue for punting in commodities</p>

					<p>However, with the setting up of three multi-commodity exchanges in the country,
						retail investors can now trade in commodity futures without having physical stocks!</p>

					<p>Commodities actually offer immense potential to become a separate asset class
						for market-savvy investors, arbitrageurs and speculators. Retail investors, who claim to
						understand the equity markets may find commodities an unfathomable market. But commodities
						are easy to understand as far as fundamentals of demand and supply are concerned. Retail
						investors should understand the risks and advantages of trading in commodities futures
						before taking a leap. Historically, pricing in commodities futures has been less volatile
						compared with equity and bonds, thus providing an efficient portfolio diversification
						option.</p>

					<p>In fact, the size of the commodities markets in India is also quite
						significant. Of the country's GDP of Rs 13,20,730 crore (Rs 13,207.3 billion), commodities
						related (and dependent) industries constitute about 58 per cent.</p>

					<p>Currently, the various commodities across the country clock an annual turnover
						of Rs 1,40,000 crore (Rs 1,400 billion). With the introduction of futures trading, the size
						of the commodities market grow many folds here on.</p>

					<p>Like any other market, the one for commodity futures plays a valuable role in
						information pooling and risk sharing. The market mediates between buyers and sellers of
						commodities, and facilitates decisions related to storage and consumption of commodities. In
						the process, they make the underlying market more liquid. Webcom Trade also offers commodity
						market software.</p>
